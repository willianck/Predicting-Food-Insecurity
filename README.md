# Predicting Food Insecurity of Households in Developing Countries
The RHoMIS(Rural Household Multi Indicator Survey) is a  survey that contains a number of core modules on farming practice, livelihoods, and food security of households.The information generated by the survey can be used to assess the prevalence of household food insecurity  and to detect changes in the food insecurity situation of a population over time which are valuable for food organisations and NGOs working in the food and Agriculture departments. In this project, we explore the RHoMIS data in an attempt to automate the process of assigning the Food insecurity level to these households and investigate the main factors that affect Food Insecurity.
